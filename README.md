# ***DRLFoil***: A Neural Network Approach to Airfoil Optimization

DRLFoil (*Deep Reinforcement Learning Foil*) is a library developed to provide an optimization framework where you can specify lift coefficient and dimensional constraints. The project began development in the context of a Final Degree Thesis, and it is currently in the alpha stage, so all contributions and feedback are appreciated!

DRLFoil works with three main libraries:
- **Neuralfoil**: This library works with Physics-Informed Neural Networks trained with XFoil, making the iterations significantly faster than with the aforementioned software.
- **Stable Baselines 3**: This is one of the most popular Reinforcement Learning libraries, providing the most important algorithms and tools for developing models.
- **Gymnasium**: An OpenAI framework that simplifies the creation of environments for deployment. It is fully compatible with SB3.
